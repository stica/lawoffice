    "title": "Personal Data Protection Law in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Why it is Important to Take the Appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) Seriously?",
    "intro": "Recently, a lot of attention has been drawn to the news that Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted a new Law on Personal Data Protection, which is largely harmonized with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, while the media and social networks mostly relay dry information about the adoption of the law, concrete explanations are lacking – what does this really mean for companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina?",
    "topicIntro": "In today’s article, I highlight the importance of complying with one of the obligations of controllers/processors, with reference to European practice.",
    "heading1": "Appointment of a DPO: A Legal Obligation That Requires Expertise",
    "dpoImportance": "In today’s business environment, the protection of personal data has become imperative for organizations of all sizes. A key role in this process is played by the Data Protection Officer (DPO), whose responsibility is to ensure compliance with the legislation and to protect individuals’ rights.",
    "legalBasis": "One of the obligations introduced by the new law is the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in certain cases.",
    "articleQuote": "According to Article 39(5) of the Law on Personal Data Protection of Bosnia and Herzegovina:",
    "articleQuote1": "\"The Data Protection Officer shall be appointed based on his or her professional qualifications, in particular expert knowledge of law and practice regarding personal data protection and the ability to perform the tasks referred to in Article 41 of this Law.\"",
    "qualificationWarning": "This means that companies should not formally appoint just any employee as a DPO simply to fulfill the legal requirement, without conducting a real assessment. The law clearly requires that the person possess appropriate legal and professional qualifications, including practical experience in the field of data protection.",
    "administrativeNote": "It is therefore important to emphasize that appointing a Data Protection Officer cannot be a mere administrative act – companies that appoint an unqualified person may face issues with oversight, improper record-keeping, violation of individuals' privacy rights, and ultimately – penalties.",
    "howToAppoint": "Companies can fulfill this legal obligation in several ways – the role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) can be assigned to a qualified person already employed in the organization, a person engaged through a service contract, or an external expert, such as a lawyer with relevant knowledge and experience.",
    "heading2": "Lessons from Practice: How Inadequate Appointment of a DPO Leads to Fines",
    "introCases": "Recent cases from European practice clearly show that an inadequate approach to this function can result in serious consequences – both financial and reputational.",
    "norwayCaseTitle": "Norway: Telecom Fined €350,000 for DPO-Related Failures",
    "norwayCaseBody": "The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) imposed a fine of NOK 4,000,000 (approximately €351,478) on the telecommunications company Telenor ASA for non-compliance with GDPR provisions relating to the appointment and role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO), as well as for inadequate organizational measures for data protection.",
    "norwayFindings": {
      "noDPO": "Failure to appoint a DPO: Telenor ASA abolished the DPO position, believing that it did not meet the criteria for appointment under Article 37(1) of the GDPR. However, it did not provide documentation to support this assessment.",
      "noContactInfo": "Lack of public contact information: The DPO’s contact details were not publicly available on the company’s website but only on the internal intranet, making them accessible only to employees.",
      "incompleteRecords": "Incomplete records of processing activities (ROPA): The investigation found that data processing records were incomplete, and the DPO was not adequately involved in data protection matters.",
      "conflict": "Conflict of interest: The DPO simultaneously held a legal counsel position, creating a potential conflict of interest."
    },
    "norwayConclusion": "This case clearly demonstrates that a superficial understanding of the DPO’s role and responsibilities can have serious consequences. The DPO must be independent, continuously and proactively involved in all activities involving data processing, and must be visible and accessible to both employees and the public.",
    "greeceCaseTitle": "Greece: Fine for Ignoring Supervisory Authority’s Request",
    "greeceCaseBody": "In 2023, as part of a broader initiative led by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA), along with most EDPB members, jointly conducted an investigation on the topic of \"Definition and Position of the Data Protection Officer\". The Hellenic DPA adopted a standardized questionnaire and sent it to 31 public bodies in Greece, including the Municipality of Athens. The Municipality failed to respond by the deadline, thereby violating the obligation to cooperate with supervisory authorities (Article 31 of the GDPR).",
    "greeceConclusion": "This case shows that the appointment of a DPO is not just an internal act, but also an obligation that requires open and continuous communication with regulators.",
    "croatiaCaseTitle": "Croatia: €169,000 in Fines for Unlawful Processing and DPO-Related Failures",
    "croatiaCaseBody": "The Croatian Data Protection Authority (AZOP) issued fines totaling €169,000, including to a company that processed data from the Ministry of the Interior’s database without a legal basis. This highlights the importance of the DPO’s role in monitoring the lawfulness of processing and the legal grounds. Two other fines were issued for failures in appointing a DPO: one of €12,000 to a casino and another of €10,000 to a company producing oils and fats.",
    "heading3": "What Does This Mean for Companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina?",
    "conclusion": "The new Law on Personal Data Protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina precisely defines the obligations that companies must fulfill, leaving little room for evasion or manipulation of legal provisions. Companies are required to bring their operations into compliance with this law no later than October 4, 2025.",
    "finalNote": "As a lawyer specializing in personal data protection, I offer expert advice to help ensure your organization is fully compliant with the Law on Personal Data Protection. If you are unsure whether your organization needs to appoint a DPO, how to properly fulfill this obligation, how to include the DPO in business processes, or how to build internal policies and procedures – now is the right time to focus on this important issue and protect your organization from potential legal and reputational risks.",

    "title": "Tokenize Your Business – Turn Your Idea into Capital",
    "intro": "Tokenization is a concept that is gaining increasing importance in modern business, representing a new financial paradigm. Imagine you have an innovative business idea, you're planning to expand production or start a new project – but lack sufficient funds. A bank loan may be unavailable, complicated, expensive, or you simply don't want to burden your business with additional debt. In that case, tokenization can offer an efficient, fast, and flexible solution for raising capital. Although a relatively new term, especially in the local context, the Serbian legal framework has taken a proactive approach to this area, recognizing its potential for domestic businesses. In this blog post, we'll explore what tokenization is, what possibilities it offers, and how it's already being applied in practice – with a special focus on Serbia, but also on the potential of Bosnia and Herzegovina to position itself as a regional hub for digital assets.",
    "whatIsTokenization": "What is Tokenization and a Digital Token?",
    "tokenizationDescription": "Simply put, tokenization is a digitized process of issuing tokens on a blockchain, which contain a specific right. A digital token is an intangible property right that digitally represents one or more other property rights, ranging from the right to use services, to a share in profits, or ownership rights over movable or immovable property. The key difference between digital tokens and traditional instruments (e.g., shares) lies in their flexibility: owning a token doesn't necessarily imply ownership rights, but depending on the structure, it can represent a right to a service, income, interest, etc. There are several types of tokens: - Payment Tokens, - Security Tokens, - Utility Tokens, and - Hybrid Tokens.",
    "legalFramework": "Regulatory Framework in Serbia",
    "legalFrameworkDescription": "With the adoption of the Digital Assets Law in 2021, Serbia became one of the first countries in Europe to legally regulate digital tokens and enable their legal issuance. Issuing digital assets does not require a license, but in the case of public advertising of the offer, prior approval of the “white paper” by the Securities Commission is required.",
    "successStories": "Successful Use Cases",
    "finspotTitle": "Finspot",
    "finspotDescription": "The most prominent example in Serbia is the company Finspot doo Belgrade, which was the first to issue digital tokens approved by the Securities Commission. The token functions like a digital bond – investors invest by purchasing the token and earn interest (up to 11.25% annually before tax). Investment is possible from as little as 10,000 RSD, and Finspot automatically calculates and pays capital income tax (15%). The FIN token is not traded on a secondary market – buying and selling is done exclusively through the issuer, at a nominal value of 1,000 RSD. This model offers a simple and legally regulated entry into the world of tokenization, while also contributing to the development of the real sector.",
    "treesuryTitle": "Treesury",
    "treesuryDescription": "To show you how broadly applicable tokenization is, let's take an example from agriculture. The Treesury token is a digital token in Serbia that links digital assets with physical assets – specifically, with hazelnut trees. It’s a digital green bond (security token) whose White Paper was approved by the Securities Commission. For every token purchased, one hazelnut tree is planted, and the investor gains a right to a share of the profits from selling the produce. The token is based on the Ethereum standard (ERC3643) and ensures full transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. Hazelnut trees begin to bear fruit in the fifth year after planting, with full yields expected three to four years later. The commercial life cycle of the orchard is estimated at around 40 years. When revenue is distributed evenly over this period, the average annual return on investment ranges from 12 to 15%, making this type of investment especially attractive – particularly considering the relative resilience of agricultural investments in times of global uncertainty, such as pandemics or geopolitical tensions. A major value of this model lies in the fact that, for the first time, investments in agriculture have become liquid. Investors who do not want to commit long-term can cash out earlier by selling their tokens on an OTC market or a regulated digital exchange, in accordance with the White Paper rules. This combination of flexibility, liquidity, and long-term yield makes tokenization one of the most modern approaches to financing and investing in agriculture, opening new possibilities for capital management.",
    "bihPotential": "Potential of Bosnia and Herzegovina",
    "bihPotentialDescription": "Bosnia and Herzegovina still lacks a law regulating digital assets or tokenization, but that doesn't mean this legal gap can’t become an opportunity. Flexible legal areas are often the best ground for developing innovation – as long as general civil law principles, particularly those of contract law, are respected, tokenization can already be applied through creative models. Businesses in BiH, especially startups, should recognize the enormous potential of tokenization as an alternative source of financing, independent of traditional banking instruments. Through tokens, development projects can be financed, services can be pre-sold, and loyalty systems can be created with customers. For countries like BiH, which have a developed IT sector and a strong diaspora, tokenization can serve as a tool for attracting investment and digitally transforming the economy. Cooperation between legal professionals, regulators, and businesses is needed to build a legal framework that enables safe and transparent use of this technology.",
